# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard application allows the user to search the globe for cities and towns in order to see their current weather as well as the upcoming five-day-forecast. The searches are saved, and the user is able to execute a new search for them by clicking on their button that is created when the initial search is run. When the forecasts are displayed, the user can view an icon that is representatitve of the current and forecasted weather, as well as the temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

## Usage

Usage of this application is simple. Just visit the deployed website, target the search bar to search for a city, and enter a valid city or town name. Click on the buttons created for previously search cities to most conveniently revist the weather for that city.

## Features

The Weather Dashboard uses a JavaScript and HTML front-end while incorporating the Bootstrap CSS framework. Within the JavaScript we are utilizing the OpenWeather 5 day weather forecast API to make fetch calls and retrieve the relevant data for the search parameters.
